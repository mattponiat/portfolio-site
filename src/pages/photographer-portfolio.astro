    <ProjectDesc>
      Portfolio website made for a photographer.<br />
      It allows you to view his photos, read about his approach to photography and
      contact him through the contact form.<br /><br />
      This project has taught me how to create forms with Formik and how to validate
      them with Yup and XState.<br />
      The function responsible for sending the emails is written in AWS Lambda.<br
      /><br />
      For storing the photos I've used Amazon S3 bucket that is connected to a custom
      subdomain.<br /><br />
      This time the site was designed by my client, but I made a lot of UI fixes
      which we both discussed and agreed on.
