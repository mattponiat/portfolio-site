    <ProjectDesc>
      Bienbot is a dashboard for a custom discord bot.<br />
      It was made for discord admins to give them an easy way to view statistics
      of their users and channels.<br />
      It is, by far, the biggest project I've ever taken part in.<br /><br />
      Frontend was made in Next.js, backend in Express and the discord bot in Discord.js.<br
      />
      UI Components Library was made with Storybook, Styled Components and Framer
      Motion.<br />
      All the data is stored in Supabase database and state is managed by Redux Toolkit.<br
      />
      Nx monorepo was used to easily store everything in one repository.<br
      /><br />
      <b>Work is still in progress.</b><br /><br />
      For now only Dashboard, User Panel and Users List are finished.<br />
      The biggest obstacle is the UI design and since we don't have a UI designer
      it takes a lot of time to create new pages.<br /><br />
      I am creating this project with <a
