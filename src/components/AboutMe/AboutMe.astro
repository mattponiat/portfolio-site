        Hi, I'm Mateusz ðŸ‘‹.<br />
        I'm a self-taught front-end web developer from Poland.<br />
        I worked as a freelancer for half a year.<br />
        I've been doing web development for 2 years.<br />
        I'm always keen on learning new technologies and boosting my front-end skills.<br
        />
        My preferred tools are React and Typescript, but I'm looking forward to learning
        Vue.js and Svelte in the future.<br />
        I've used Next.js the most and I'm currently trying out T3 Stack to learn more about backend.
